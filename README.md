# PCCS-app_project_355
app_project_355 created for PCCS

The goal of this project, Gaming Forecast, is to create an android app that allows gamers to keep in touch while leading a busy,
on the go, care free sort of lifestyle. It allows the user to stay connected to all the games they possibly want, but without
all the hastle of constantly searching up information, release dates, etc.

Created by Pulkit, Chris, Curtis, and Sherdil (AKA PCCS).
