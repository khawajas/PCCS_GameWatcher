# PCCS-app_project_355
app_project_355 created for PCCS

The goal of this project, Gaming Forecast, is to create an android app that allows gamers to keep in touch while leading a busy,
on the go, care free sort of lifestyle. It allows the user to stay connected to all the games they possibly want, but without
all the hastle of constantly searching up information, release dates, etc.

Created by Pulkit, Chris, Curtis, and Sherdil (AKA PCCS).

For the first iteration we started pretty late due to the bike race and some unfortunate circumstances.
We barely had enough time, and not enough people contributed, but we did get the app to work.

The HARDEST part of this is easily the espresso test, just because it's code that most of us can't understand or 
where we should be calling what function.

Next iteration we'll start earlier. Like... right away. - Pulkit R
